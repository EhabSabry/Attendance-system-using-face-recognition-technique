# Attendance-system-using-face-recognition-technique
The attendance management system is a system that can be used in universities, companies, factories, and so on.
 
It can be used to calculate the hours for which employees work accurately.

 It also can be used for tracking the arrivals of your employees without the need of another employee to track this process.
and this system can 
1. detect and recognize faces in a video, picture, or real world.

2. Detect and recognize unknown people that have no pictures in our dataset and take a photo of them and store it in a specific place.

3. Calculate the arrival time of the employees.

4. Sending emails to the one who is responsible for the arrival times

and we use libraries like 
1. open-cv
2. numpy
3. face recognition
4. os
5. DateTime
